We don’t know ahead of time which headlines go in which clusters, so we need a machine learning algorithm to find the clusters for us based on the data we provide.\n","\n","* We are using machine learning to extract additional information from our data set, but this time we are compressing the data instead of adding more.

This is common in data science: often the fastest way to find out if an algorithm is working properly is to assess the outputs with your own knowledge. We can be quite accurate in immediately spotting if something is off with the model.\n","> * Again, notice the iterative nature of this section. It will require several tries to find the best model parameters. Don’t get frustrated if you can’t figure them out at first.
